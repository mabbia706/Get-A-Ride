# Get-A-Ride
This application operates between a driver and the user who is looking out for a ride. Main components include internet availability and google maps. The app creates a user profile based on the user type. The driver has to mention the rate charged per kilometer. Once the profile is created the user selects a route(pickup-drop off point) and time, a notification is sent to the drivers who are registered on that route. Once the driver accepts it, the user selects a driver from the list of accepted notifications. The user and driver can then coordinate among themselves via message or call(this option will be available inside the app). After completion of the ride, user pays the fare and driver acknowledges that payment has been received.
